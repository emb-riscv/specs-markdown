# Chapter 1: Introduction

This is a draft of the microcontroller architecture description document for RISC-V. Feedback welcome.

## Goal

Define a set of specifications for RISC-V microcontrolers used in bare metal embedded systems.

## Limitations

These specifications intentionaly **do not** include application class devices which use virtual memory and/or have supervisor/hypervisor modes and run an operating system (like GNU/Linux). These devices are covered by the "RISC-V Privileged Architecture" specifications.

## Mission Statement

Define a modern C/C++ friendly microcontroller architecture, that makes writing embedded software easier and more productive. And more fun!
