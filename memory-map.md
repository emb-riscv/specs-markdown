# Memory map

Generally the RISC-V microcontroller memory map is implementation specific; the only reserved area 
is a slice of 256 MiB at the end of the memory space.

For 32-bits devices, the reserved system area is **0xF0000000-0xFFFFFFFF**.

For 64-bits devices, the reserved system area is **0xFFFFFFFF'F0000000-0xFFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFF**.

Typical RISC-V microcontroller devices have:

- a **read-only code** area, usually at 0x00000000, but the actual address may be implementation 
specific (typically flash)
- a **read-write data** area (typically RAM)
- an implementation specific **peripheral** area.

Multi-hart devices can share certain memory areas (code or data), but can also have hart-specific 
memory areas, or both shared and specific areas.

## The system control areas

The system control areas are implemented as a pair of memory-mapped address spaces, one providing control and status registers common for the entire 
device, and one providing control and status registers for the current hart:

| Base | Top | Name | Description |
|:-----|:----|:-----|-------------|
| 0xF000'0000 | 0xF000'XXXX | `dcb` | The Device Control Block. |
| 0xF0XX'XXXX | 0xF0XX'XXXX | `sysclock` | The Device System Clock. |
| 0xF0XX'XXXX | 0xF0XX'XXXX | `rtclock` | The Device Real-Time Clock. |
| 0xF0XX'XXXX | 0xF0XX'XXXX | `wdog` | The Device Watchdog Timer. |
| | | | |
| 0xF100'0000 | 0xF100'0FFF | `hcb` | The Hart Control Block. |
| 0xF100'2000 | 0xF100'3FFF | `hic` | The Hart Interrupt Controller. |

Each hart has its own separate control block; all HCBs map to the same address, the internal 
logic being able to distinguish between them based on the ID of the hart requesting access;
thus each hart can access only its own hart control block. 

Same for the Hart Interrupt Controller.

(the addresses are preliminary, need more work to find a solution easy to decode)
