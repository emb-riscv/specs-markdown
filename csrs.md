# The Control and Status Registers (CSRs)

The RISC-V ISA defines a set of 4096 Control and Status Registers that can be accessed 
via special `csr` instructions with immediate operands identifying the register.

For performance reasons, in the RISC-V microcontroller profile only a small number 
of core system registers are required to be CSRs; the rest are available in the memory 
mapped system area.

Unless otherwise mentioned, write access to these CSRs is limited to machine/privileged mode.

## Hart ID Register (`hartid`)

The `hartid` CSR is an XLEN-bit read-only register containing the integer ID of the 
hart running the code. This register must be readable in any implementation. 
In single-hart devices, it always reads 0. In multi-hart devices, the hart IDs might 
not necessarily be numbered contiguously
(althoug it is preferable), but at least one hart must have a hart ID of zero.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [N:0] | `hartid` | ro | | The integer ID of the hart. |
| [(xlen-1):(N+1)] | | | | Reserved. |

N is the number of bits required to store the maximum hart ID and is implementation specific.

This CSR is identical to `mhartid` in the RISC-V privileged profile.

## Configuration and control (`ctrl`)

The `ctrl` CSR is an XLEN-bit read/write register that controls several aspects of the hart
functionality.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [?] | `sptena` | r | 0 | Thread stack enable: <br>- 0: always use `spm` as `sp`. <br>- 1: in **application** mode use `spt` as `sp`. |
| [?] | `stackalign` | rw | (\*1) | The context stack alignment: <br>- 0: 4-bytes alignment guaranteed, no SP adjustment is performed.<br>- 1: 8-bytes alignment guaranteed, SP adjusted if necessary.|
| [?] | `spadjusted` | r | 0 | Reserved bit used during context push/pop to remember if the stack required an extra alignment word. | 
| [?] | `fpena` | rw | 0 | Floating point enable: <br>- 0: if the FP unit is disabled.<br>- 1: if the FP unit is enabled. |
| [?] | `fpcxs` | rw | 1 | Floating point context save: <br>- 0: if the context stack should not save FP registers. <br>- 1: if the context stack should save FP registers. |
| [?] | `fplazy` | rw | 1 | Floating point lazy context save: <br>- 0: disable automatic lazy context save.<br>- 1: enable automatic lazy context save. |
| [(xlen-1):?] | | | | Reserved. |

\*1: The default value for the `stackalign` is implementaion specific; the 
recommended default is 1.

TODO: decide if a `reset` bit (to reset the current hart) fits here, and 
where should be a `sysreset` to reset the entire device.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Mode and status (`status`)

The `status` CSR is an XLEN-bit read/write register that identifies the 
current hart mode and status.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [?] | `handler` | r | 0 | Hart is running:<br>- 0: application code.<br>- 1: handler code. |
| [?] | `user` | r | 0 | Application privileges:<br>- 0: machine/privileged mode.<br>- 1: user/unprivileged mode. |
| [(xlen-2):(xlen-16)] | `cause` | r | 0 | The exception or interrupt cause code. |
| [(xlen-1)] | `interrupt` | r | 0 | If `handler` is set, then<br>1 if in an interrupt, 0 if in an exception |

The handler code is always running in machine/privileged mode.

TODO: the bits in this register, as the entire mechanism to enter/exit 
exceptions and traps, requires a thorough analysis.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Interrupt Enable (`iena`)

The `iena` CSR is an XLEN-bit read/write register that controls whether the interrupt 
are enabled or not. 

This register has a single bit on purpose. Access to the interrupt enable bit must be quite 
fast since masking all interrupts is one of the methods used to implement critical sections.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | `iena` | rw | 0 | Interrupts Enable; 1 if interrupts are enabled. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | | | | Reserved. |

This CSR is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Interrupt Priority Threshold (`iprioth`)

The `iprioth` CSR is an XLEN-bit read/write register that holds the interrupts threshold. 
Only interrupts requests that have a priority strictly greater than the threshold will cause 
an interrupt to become active. The threshold register must always be able to hold the value zero, 
in which case, no interrupts are masked. The threshold register must also be able to hold 
the maximum priority level, in which case all interrupts are masked (functionally equivalent 
to disabling interrupts). 

This register is a CSR because handling the interrupts threshold is one of the methods used 
to implement critical sections, and this must be as fast as possible.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [N:0] | `iprioth` | rw | 0x00 | The interrupt priority threshold. |
| [(xlen-1):(N+1)] | | | | Reserved. |

N is the number of bits required to store the maximum priority level, and is implementation 
specific. It must match the number of bits used by the `prio` register in the interrupt 
controller.

All reserved bits read back as 0. To find out N at runtime, an application can write an 
'all-1' pattern and read back the register.

If the hart does not implement an interrupt controller, the whole register reads back as zero.

This CSR is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Interrupt Priority Threshold Increase (`ipriothinc`)

The `ipriothinc` CSR behaves like an XLEN-bit read/write register, but in fact uses the
same register as `iprioth`. The difference is that writes to this CSR are effective only 
if the new value is higher than the current value, in other words it guarantees that the
interrupt threshold is not decreased.

This register is a CSR because handling the interrupts threshold is one of the methods used 
to implement critical sections, and this must be as fast as possible.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [N:0] | `ipriothinc` | rw | 0x00 | The interrupt priority threshold. |
| [(xlen-1):(N+1)] | | | | Reserved. |

N is the number of bits required to store the maximum priority level, and is implementation 
specific.

This CSR is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: possibly find a better name. how about `ipriothup`?

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Main Stack Pointer (`spm`)

The `spm` CSR is an XLEN-bit read-write register that holds the main stack pointer. 
It is always the default stack pointer after reset. Interrupts and exceptions always 
use this stack to store the exception frame.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `spm` | rw | startup | The main stack pointer. |

This CSR is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: check if the stack has more strict alignment requirements.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Main Stack Pointer Limit (`spmlimit`)

The `msplimit` CSR is an XLEN-bit read-write register that holds the lowest address 
the main stack can descend.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `spmlimit` | rw | startup | The main stack lower limit. |

If an operation using the main stack pointer attempts to write to an address below 
the limit, an exception is triggered and the operation is not performed.

This CSR is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Thread Stack Pointer (`spt`)

The `spt` CSR is an XLEN-bit read-write register that holds the stack pointer used 
by the application current thread. It is intended to multi-threaded applications.

This register is a CSR because access to the stack pointer may occur in context switching 
routines and needs to be fast.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `spt` | rw | Unknown | The thread stack pointer. |

This CSR is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Thread Stack Pointer Limit (`sptlimit`)

The `tsplimit` CSR is an XLEN-bit read-write register that holds the lowest address 
the thread stack can descend.

This register is a CSR because access to the stack pointer limit may occur in context switching 
routines and needs to be fast.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `sptplimit` | rw | Unknown | The thread stack lower limit. |

If an operation using the thread stack pointer attempts to write to an address below 
the limit, an exception is triggered and the operation is not performed.

This CSR is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Exception Program Counter (`epc`)

The `epc` CSR is an XLEN-bit read/write register that holds the trap address. The low bit of 
`epc` (`epc[0]`) is always zero. 

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `epc` | rw | Unknown | Exception PC address. |

On implementations that do not support instruction-set 
extensions with 16-bit instruction alignment, the two low bits (`epc[1:0]`) are always zero.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [1:0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):2] | `epc` | rw | Unknown | Exception PC address. |

When an exception is taken, `epc` is written with the address of the instruction that 
encountered the exception. Otherwise `mepc` is never written by the implementation.

This CSR is similar to `mepc` from the RISC-V privileged profile.

> <sup>In the privileged specs, `mepc` may be explicitly written by software. Here this
it is not needed, execution will resume to the address pushed onto the main stack.</sup>

## Machine Trap Value Register (`mtval`)

The `mtval` CSR is an XLEN-bit read-write register. When an exception is taken,
`mtval` is written with exception-specific information to assist software in handling the 
exception. Otherwise, `mtval` is never written by the implementation, though it may be 
explicitly written by software.

This CSR is identical with `mtval` from the RISC-V privileged profile.

## RISC-V compatibility CSRs

The RISC-V Volume I, Chapter 2.8, mentions two mandatory instructions, `rdcycle` and 
`rdinstret`; to implement them, two CSRs are required:

- cycle: available as `hcb.cyclecnt`
- instret: available as `hcb.instcnt`

The RISC-V Volume II, mentions other CSRs, but it is not clear which one are mandatory, 
if any:

- mstatus: not needed, there is only one bit needed, mie, which is now n the `iena` CSR.
- mcause: no longer needed, the cause is packed in the `status` CSR
- mie: not needed, interrupts are enabled in the HIC registers
- mip: not needed, interrupt pending bits are in the HIC registers
- mtvec: not needed, there are two memory mapped registers, `excvta` and `intvta`
- misa: can be safely migrated to memory mapped

- mscratch: not decided if needed

TODO: 

- add MPU registers

## Usage

### Interrupt critical sections

In a single hart device, the simple ways to implement critical section is to 
fully disable interrupts, assuming the application does not need to keep any 
fast interrupts enabled. 

```c
void
f1(void)
{
  // ...
  {
    // Interrupts critical section.
    xlenreg_t status = riscv_csr_write_iena(0);
    // ...
    riscv_csr_write_iena(status);
  }
  // ...
}
```

Otherwise, if the application uses some fast interrupts, it can raise the 
interrupt threashold to a limit below the fast interrupts priority. Please 
note how entering the critical sections guarantees that the threashold is 
not lowered.

```c
void 
f2(void)
{
  // ...
  {
    // Interrupts critical section.
    xlenreg_t status = riscv_csr_write_ipriothinc(7);
    // ...
    riscv_csr_write_iprioth(status);
  }
  // ...
}
```
