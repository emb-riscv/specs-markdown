# The Control and Status Registers (CSRs)

The RISC-V ISA defines a set of 4096 Control and Status Registers that can be accessed 
via special `csr` instructions with immediate operands identifying the register.

In the RISC-V microcontroller profile only a small number of core system registers 
are accessible via the `csr` instructions, the rest being memory mapped.

## Hart ID Register (`mhartid`)

The `mhartid` CSR is an XLEN-bit read-only register containing the integer ID of the 
hardware thread running the code. This register must be readable in any implementation. 
Hart IDs might not necessarily be numbered contiguously in a multiprocessor system, 
but at least one hart must have a hart ID of zero.

The RISC-V microcontroller profile limits the thread ID to 1023.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [9:0] | `mhartid` | ro | | The integer ID of the hart. |
| [(xlen-1):10] | | | | Reserved. |

## Machine Status Register (`mstatus`)

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [2:0] | | | | Reserved. |
| [3] | `mie` | rw | 0 | Machine Interrupts Enable; 1 if interrupts are enabled. |
| [(xlen-1):4] | | | | Reserved. |

## Machine Exception Program Counter (`mepc`)

`mepc` is an XLEN-bit read/write register that holds the trap address. The low bit of 
`mepc` (`mepc[0]`) is always zero. 

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `mepc` | rw | Unknown | Exception PC address. |

On implementations that do not support instruction-set 
extensions with 16-bit instruction alignment, the two low bits (`mepc[1:0]`) are always zero.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [1:0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):2] | `mepc` | rw | Unknown | Exception PC address. |

When an exception is taken, `mepc` is written with the address of the instruction that 
encountered the exception. Otherwise `mepc` is never written by the implementation.

> <sup>In the privileged specs, `mepc` may be explicitly written by software. Here this
it is not needed, execution will resume to the address pushed onto the main stack.</sup>

## Machine Cause Register (`mcause`)

The `mcause` register is an XLEN-bit read-write register. When an exception or interrupt is
taken `mcause` is written with a code indicating the event that caused the exception or the
interrupt. Otherwise `mcause` is never written by the implementation.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [9:0] | `cause` | rw | Unknown | The cause code. |
| [(xlen-2):10] | | | | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1)] | `interrupt` | rw | Unknown | 1 if interrupt, 0 if exception. |

## Machine Trap Value Register (`mtval`)

The `mtval` register is an XLEN-bit read-write register. When an exception is taken,
`mtval` is written with exception-specific information to assist software in handling the 
exception. Otherwise, `mtval` is never written by the implementation, though it may be 
explicitly written by software.

## Machine Main Stack Pointer (`mmsp`)

The stack pointer used after reset. Interrupts ansd exceptions always use this stack
to store the exception frame.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `mmsp` | rw | startup | The main stack pointer. |

This register is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Machine Main Stack Pointer Limit (`mmsplimit`)

The lowest address the main stack can descend.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `mmsplimit` | rw | startup | The main stack lower limit. |

This register is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Machine Thread Stack Pointer (`mtsp`)

The stack pointer used by the application current thread.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `mtsp` | rw | 0 | The thread stack pointer. |

This register is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## Machine Thread Stack Pointer Limit (`mtsplimit`)

The lowest address the thread stack can descend.

| Bits | Name | Type | Reset | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|-------------|
| [0] | | | 0 | Reserved. |
| [(xlen-1):1] | `mtsplimit` | rw | 0 | The thread stack lower limit. |

This register is specific to the RISC-V microcontroller profile.

TODO: allocate a number for it.

## RISC-V compatibility CSRs

These registers are mandated by the RISC-V Volume I, Chapter 2.8, for the `rdcycle` and `rdinstret` instructions.

- cycle: available as `hcb.cyclecnt`
- instret: available as `hcb.instcnt`

Other RISC-V registers from RISC-V Volume II, but not actively used:

- mie: not needed, interrupts are enabled in the HIC registers
- mip: not needed, interrupt pending bits are in the HIC registers
- mtvec: not needed, there are two memory mapped registers, `excvta` and `intvta`
- misa: can be safely migrated to memory mapped

- mscratch: not decided if needed

TODO: 

- add MPU registers
