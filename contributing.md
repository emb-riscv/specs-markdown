# Appendix C: Contributing

As for most open source projects, all contributions are welcomed!

## Bugs

Any mistakes that are identified, either typos, logic mistakes, wrong
argumentations, etc, should be addressed as Bugs in the
[Issues](https://github.com/emb-riscv/specs-markdown/issues) section.

## Enhancements

Clearly defined proposals should be addressed as Enhancements to the
[Issues](https://github.com/emb-riscv/specs-markdown/issues) section,
or, even better, as
[Pull requests](https://github.com/emb-riscv/specs-markdown/pulls).

### C/C++ use cases

Proposals should be accompanied by use-cases in C/C++, and solid argumentation
why the new solution is more efficient and/or easier to use than existing
solutions.

Please don't forget that the mission statement is to "define a modern
C/C++ friendly architecture", so solutions that cannot be expressed in
C/C++ need a very good argumentation to be seriously considered.
