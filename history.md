# Appendix B: History

The open source project was created on GitHub in October 2017 (the
[The Embedded RISC-V Project](https://github.com/emb-riscv)), 
but initially there was no content available.

Work on the first proposal of the specs started in late January 2108, with the
text formatted as markdown, and the preliminary version 0.1.1 was ready by the 
end of February 2018, and submitted to selected readers for feedback.
